                    JEE stands for Joint Entrance Examination. JEE is different from NEET its partner from medical field.JEE has two levels of examination one is mains and other is advanced.JEE mains is held twice a year in January and May and advanced is held ones in April every year.<br>
                    Only those persons who qualify in JEE mains get to seat in JEE advanced and they can take admission in IIT.<br>
                    <strong>Although having more than 1000 seats in IIT campus for foreign nationals merely less than 10 qualifications are made.It has been found that Nepali students are not much aware about it. Yes, IIt is hard to crack but remember being a foreighn student it becomes quite easy than your fellow Indian partner.You only have to get beyond 10,300 rank we suppose.It is wolrth a try bexcause IITians get paid in hundreed thousand of dollars as annual package.</strong>

                        <h4>What is the marking sceme?</h4>
                        ===>We get 4 marks for one correct answer and -1 for any incorrect answer but we get no any negative marks for unattended question and numerical type question<br>
                        <i>Well, statistically it is favourable to get benifited if you know that atleast one of the answer are wrong. But it is better to leave unattended if you are completely guessing as it might save you some time.It is always wise to attend numerical type question.</i>
