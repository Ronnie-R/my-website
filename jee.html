            <h1>JEE</h1>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>JEE stands for Joint Entrance Examination. (It is quite confused with IIT. We will clear the confusion in the section below)</li>
            <li>JEE is conducted by NTA (NAtional Testing Agency). The same agency which conducts NEET.</li>
            <li>JEE is conducted twice a year.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>JEE main: </em>JEE main is first phase of examination. JEE main is carried out twice a year all across the country during January and April.</li>
                    <li><em>JEE advanced: </em>JEE advanced is second phase of examination. It is carried out by all 23 IITs following rotational basis. The exam is conducted for admission in IITs. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is confusion on what IIT and JEE are.So, to be clear IIT are autonomous universities.<br>Each IIT are university among themselves.They have admission process and they need to refine candidates. So, they conduct examination called JEE in two phase. After first phase of refinement by government IITs conduct scondd phase of examnation themselves.</p>
        <p>The examination conducted for masters level in IITs are called GATE.</p>
        <h5>How many students appear in JEE mains examnation?</h5>
        <p>We can easily see number of studets appearing in JEE is declining every year whic is a good sign because people are being focused in alternative careear.But speculations made shows that there are nearly 10 lakh people registerd for JEE in 2021. </p>
